# BassFlute
This is a Native Instruments Kontakt patch based on Bass Flute samples done at University of Iowa by  Lawrence Fritts, Director of the Electronic Music Studios and Professor of Composition.

The samples are not well-suited to producing a playable instrument, due to variations in pitch, envelope, and timing. I've taken several measures to mitigate that, including blending notes pitch-shifted variants, and incomplete editing of the start timing and pitch correction.

I hope to further improve the patch, but since bass flute patches seem to be almost non-existent (and I'm aware of no other free version at all) I'm making it available in its current form.

You need the full version of Kontakt 6 (or higher), and have navigate to the .nki file.
